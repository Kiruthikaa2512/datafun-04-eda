# DataFun-04: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on structured datasets. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights, clean data, visualize distributions, and identify trends that inform decision-making.

## Repository Structure
The project follows a structured workflow to maintain clarity and reproducibility:

```plaintext
datafun-04-eda/
│-- requirements.txt    # Dependencies for the virtual environment
│-- .gitignore          # Files to exclude from Git tracking
│-- README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions
To get started, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com//datafun-04-eda.git
   cd datafun-04-eda
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**  
   ```shell
   py -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate   # (Use `source .venv/bin/activate` for Mac/Linux)
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Workflow
The typical process for working on this project includes:
1. Pulling the latest updates from GitHub.
2. Loading and cleaning datasets.
3. Generating summary statistics and visualizations.
4. Documenting insights and next steps.
5. Pushing changes back to GitHub.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Goals
- Identify missing values and outliers.
- Understand data distributions with histograms and box plots.
- Perform correlation analysis.
- Generate key summary statistics.

## Example Commands
